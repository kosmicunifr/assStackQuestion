This plugin is an ILIAS port of STACK, developed by Chris Sangwin. It provides a test question type
for mathematical questions that are calculated by a the Computer Algebra System (CAS) Maxima.
See the original STACK documentation at http://stack.bham.ac.uk/moodle

Additional Software Requirements
--------------------------------

* Maxima (http://maxima.sourceforge.net)

Maxima is a open sorce computer algebra system and part of most Linux distributions.
A version for windows is available, too. Maxima needs to be installed on the web server running
your ILIAS installation.
Either install the package from your linux distribution or download and install it from
sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/)

* GNUplot (http://www.gnuplot.info)

GNUplot is used by maxima to generate graphical plots of functions etc. It is freely available
and part of most Linux distrubutions. GNUplot needs to be installed on the web server
running your ILIAS and maxima installations.
Either install the package from your linux distribution or download and install it from
sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/)

* MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org)

MathJax is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics. It is used by the STACK plugin
to display maths in question, user input validation and feedback. It can either be linked from
cdn.mathjax.org or downloaded to your own web server. It has to be configured in ILIAS:

1. Go to Administration > Third Party Software > MathJax
2. Enable MathJax and enter the URL to MathJax (local or proposed cdn)
3. Save

First Installation of the plugin
--------------------------------
1. Copy the assStackQuestion directory to your ILIAS installation at the followin path
(create subdirectories, if neccessary):
Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions/assStackQuestion

2. Go to Administration > Plugins
3. Choose action "Update" for the assStackQuestion plugin
4. Choose action "Activate" for the assStackQuestion plugin
5. Choose action "Refresh Languages" for the assStackQuestion plugin

Configuration and test of the plugin
------------------------------------
1. Go to Administration > Plugins
2. Choose action "Configure" for the assStackQuestion plugin
3. Set the platform type and maxima version according your installation
4. Go to the tab "Health Check" and click "Do Health Check"
5. If some checks are not passed, click "Show Debugging Data" to get more information

Import of questions from moodleXML
----------------------------------
1. Create an ILIAS question pool
2. Click "Create question", choose "Stack Question" and click "Create"
3. Click "Create Question from MoodleXML"
4. Select a moodleXML package on your computer and click "Import"

Usage of STACK questions
------------------------
You can work with a STACK question like any other question in ILIAS. You can preview it in the question pool
and already try it out there. You can copy it to an ILIAS test and use it there.  A a test participant you will
normally answer a question in two steps. First you enter your answer as a formula in an input field and click "Validate"
beneath that field to check how your input is interpretet. This will give you a graphical version of you entry which may
already be simplified. If you entry can't be interpreted, you will get an error message. When you are satisfied with your
input you can evaluate your answer (in self assessment mode) or move to the next question (in an exam).

Version History
===============

* The stable version 3.0.x for **ILIAS 5.3** with new functionalities from STACK such a new input types is found in the Github branch **master-ilias53**
* The stable version 2.4.x for **ILIAS 5.2 to 5.3** is found in the GitHub branch **master-ilias52**
* The stable version 2.3.x for **ILIAS 5.0 to 5.1** is found in the GitHub branch **master**

Update from Version 2.x
-----------------------
After updating the code files of the plugin, the update is started in the plugin administration of ILIAS.
All STACK questions of your platform will be translated to the new syntax for CAS text in STACK (use of {@..@} instead of @...@)
This change is automatically done in the plugin update, but we recommend to check the questions before use it in tests.

PLEASE BACKUP YOUR DATABASE before you run the update from an older version. Depending on the number of questions, the update takes some minutes, please set the PHP variable max_execution_time high enough.

The translation is also done when importing questions from ILIAS or MoodleXML, but please notice that this conversion is one way.You can import "old CASText behaviour" questions to a platform with STACK plugin version 3.0+.
But if you import "new CASText behaviour" questions to a platform with a previous version of the plugin, your question will not be properly shown on that platform.

Version 3.0.8 (2018-09-07) for ILIAS 5.3
----------------------------------------
Inputs representation in validation and best solution now takes the minimal size as possible, depending on user  or teacher input, and it´s displayed as code text, instead of repeating the input again

Version 3.0.7 (2018-09-03) for ILIAS 5.3
----------------------------------------
Some important changes has been made to question view, either in preview, test mode or printview, the main goal of this changes is to fulfill the needs of SIG Mathe+ILIAS in terms of going back to previous 5.2 style of inputs presentation
- All inputs which can be validated got the validation view changed to a disabled input or textarea filled in with the user solution on the left side, and the validation feedback on the right side.
- Validation messages are now displayed with a white background in order to distinct it from question text.
- The behaviour of inputs presentation in best solution in aligned to validation, instead of showing only a message saying "a possible solution is..." a disabled input is presented filled in with the model answer, All these inputs have the same format as the question input.

Version 3.0.0 (2018-03-07) for ILIAS 5.3
----------------------------------------
This is a major update. It uses the core classes from STACK version 4.0, the sample questions have also be changed. Please read the section "Update from version 2.x".

NEW FEATURES:
- 8 new input types (We highly recommend to read the Documentation of all new input types that can be found here: https://stack2.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo/question/type/stack/doc/doc.php/Authoring/Inputs.md):
	- Numerical input:
      This input type requires the student to type in a number of some kind. Any expression with a variable will be rejected as invalid.
    - Scientific units input:
    The support for scientific units includes an input type which enables teachers to check units as valid/invalid.
    - Equivalence reasoning input:
      The purpose of this input type is to enable students to work line by line and reason by equivalence. Note, the teacher's answer and any syntax hint must be a list! If you just pass in an expression strange behaviour may result.
    - Dropdown/Checkbox/Radio:
      The dropdown, checkbox and radio input types enable teachers to create multiple choice questions.
    - String input:
      This is a normal input into which students may type whatever they choose. It is always converted into a Maxima string internally. Note that there is no way whatsoever to parse the student's string into a Maxima expression. If you accept a string, then it will always remain a string! You can't later check for algebraic equivalence, the only tests available will be simple string matches, regular expressions etc
    - Notes input
      This input is a text area into which students may type whatever they choose. It can be used to gather their notes or "working". However, this input always returns an empty value to the CAS, so that the contents are never assessed.
 - CASText now supports conditional statements and adaptive blocks.
 - Healthcheck has been rebuilt, now shows more information about the CAS connection and the Maxima version used.
 - Maxima Libraries can be added to maximalocal from plugin configuration (Notice that this feature doesn't work with server configuration)
